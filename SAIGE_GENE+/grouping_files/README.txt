## This directory containts grouping files for rare variants that passed our QC and analysis filters in our study. The grouping files are in SAIGE-GENE+ format.
## NB1: variant IDs are in format chr:pos:ref:alt
## --> Depending on how the genetic data is saved, you might need to add "chr" before the variant IDs. 
## NB2: variants are restricted to those found among the initial 200k WES release of UKB. If investigators would like similar grouping files for the full 450k, that can be discussed!
